#### what is K-Means ?
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm (meaning there are no target labels) that allows you to identify similar groups or clusters of data points within your data. The group based on their distance to the centroid (A centroid is just the mean (average) position of all points in a cluster).

popularity: the popularity rate of the track,
danceability:The relative measurement of the track being danceable,

## Data Preprocessing

**import library**
-for anlalyzing data we use pandas and numpy library,
-visualizing data we use matplotlib and seaborn,
-for machine learning mostly we use sklearn.
